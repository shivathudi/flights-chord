Chord Diagram of Domestic Flights. Uses d3.js

All flight visualizations can be found at:

# Domestic Flights in USA for 2016
### Final Project for Data Visualization (MSAN 622)

I used d3.js for making different visualizations of flights data from the Bureau of Transporation. These are the plots I made:

- [Chord Diagram](https://shivathudi.github.io/flights-chord/)
  - Shows the frequency of flights between the top 30 domestic airports in the US. Smaller airports are grouped into the "Other Cities" category.

- [Delay Choropleth](https://shivathudi.github.io/flights-choropleth/)
  - Shows the percentage of flights delayed from states across the US. The color red encodes this percentage, with deeper shades signifying higher percentages of flights delayed

- [Parallel Coordinates](https://shivathudi.github.io/flights-parcoord/)
  - Shows multidimensional relationships across carriers - such as the number of flights, the distance in miles, air time in minutes, arrival and departure delays in minutes, etc.
